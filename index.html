  <h1>Probabilistic Justification of the GPS-Goldbach Model</h1>
  <h3>Bahbouhi Bouchaib, Independent Researcher, Nantes, France</h3>

  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    We present a probabilistic justification for the GPS-Goldbach model based on a mathematical expression of the prime gap centered around E/2. Our goal is to explain why the pair (p, q) = (E/2 − δ, E/2 + δ) with both p and q prime becomes increasingly predictable as E grows. We compare this with known theorems and propose a new effective equation for locating Goldbach pairs.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    The Goldbach Conjecture asserts that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes. Numerous numerical verifications have confirmed its validity up to very large numbers. Our approach aims to provide a new probabilistic explanation based on an efficient predictive interval centered around E/2 and defined by:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    δ(E) ≈ √E · (log log E) / log E
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    We call this the "GPS gap", and it functions as a predictive radius within which we expect to find both prime numbers (p, q) such that p + q = E. The remarkable efficiency of this interval is that it often contains both primes simultaneously.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Comparison to Known Theorems</h2>
  <p>
    Our GPS gap aligns closely with major probabilistic models such as Cramér’s model [1], the Prime Number Theorem [2], and bounds given in Hardy–Littlewood formulations [3]. However, most classical theorems provide only asymptotic density or statistical estimates, while our method suggests a practical and deterministic zone for locating prime pairs.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Main Result and Observations</h2>
  <p>
    For any even number E ≥ 10⁶, computing δ(E) gives an interval I = [E/2 − δ, E/2 + δ]. Empirically, this interval almost always contains two primes (p, q) satisfying p + q = E. This contrasts with classical bounds which do not guarantee proximity of both primes to E/2. Our model consistently yields these primes even for large E, demonstrating the effectiveness of the GPS radius.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Discussion and Implications</h2>
  <p>
    We interpret the GPS interval as a probabilistic well where the prime pair (p, q) “falls” into a symmetrical zone around E/2. This leads to the conjecture:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    For every even number E ≥ 4, the interval I(E) = [E/2 − δ(E), E/2 + δ(E)] contains at least one pair (p, q) of primes such that E = p + q.
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    This can be viewed as a practical reformulation of the Strong Goldbach Conjecture, now expressed in a predictive, bounded form. We hope this brings new insights for future analytic or computational approaches.
