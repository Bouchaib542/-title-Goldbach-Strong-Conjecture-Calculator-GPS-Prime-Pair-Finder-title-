This repository presents the article:

**Probabilistic Justification of the GPS Model for Goldbach's Conjecture**  
*by Bahbouhi Bouchaib, Independent Researcher, Nantes, France*

🧠 This article proposes a new conjecture based on the interval  
**δ(E) ≈ √E · (log log E)/log E**,  
which almost always contains two primes (p, q) such that p + q = E, even for very large even integers.  
It offers a narrow and effective alternative to classical theorems and may open new paths toward a proof of the strong Goldbach Conjecture.
