# Probabilistic Justification of the GPS Model for Goldbach's Conjecture

This website presents a mathematical article offering a probabilistic justification for the GPS-based interval used to predict prime pairs (p, q) such that **p + q = E**, for even numbers E up to **10¹⁰⁰⁰⁰**. The model relies on an optimal gap derived from:

> δ(E) ≈ √E · (log log E) / log E

The article discusses how this interval ensures the existence of **two simultaneous primes** around E/2 with overwhelming probability, potentially contributing to a proof of the **strong Goldbach Conjecture**.
